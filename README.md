# IHS
SPA web application for International Hip Society (IHS).

## Technology stack
- [Bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org) ([Bootstrap 4](http://getbootstrap.com/) as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) components)
- [Storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/)
- [Vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

This solution is built with Vue components AND works in IE11, thanks to [html-imports](https://github.com/webcomponents/html-imports) and a little tweaking.
One difference is that components are saved as `.html` files instead of `.vue` files.
